# Sleeping-Pattern-Prediction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my machine learning models aimed at predicting sleeping pattern. This project utilizes Python to develop an advanced predictive model, contributing to improved people's sleep and quality of life as well as the efficient use of smart homes.
# Overview
The dataset used in this project is sourced from over 600 pieces of my sleep data collected by my wearable device between 2021 and 2023, and the application AutoSleep records a range of metrics related to my sleep wake-up time, quality sleep and deep sleep time, sleep heart rate and respiration. I was able to use these data to train four models including MLP, LSTM, Random Forest and GBM to predict the wake up time. Best MSE is 3000 which means that means there's a 40-minute margin of error.
